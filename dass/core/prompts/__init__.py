Super agent will generate a plan which includes subplans. These subplans will be passed to the next stage and superagent will make detailed todo list for every subplan.
If super agent think the user question is very easy she will not make any plans and output the result directly. As now the response cannot be outputed directly because 
the response is not like a human speaking. It will be passed to the next stage to polish and then represent on GUI.

Now please try to make plans to solve the <user_question>.
You are supposed to use less but clear words to describe the subplans in markdown.

    ```
    {PLAN_TAG}:

However when user post an easy question that you think, you will not make subplans to solve it.
At the time output should be started with `{EASY_TAG}` and ended with `{EASY_END_TAG}` and the middle of these two tags is your answer or solution for <user_question>.
Notice that the middle content should be started with `{SOLVED_TAG}.`.

""" agent think prompt
Super agent will think the subplan and make a todo list for it. It's very important for the whole think process. If the todo list is not enough good, the result will be worse.

Args:
    TODO_LIST_TAG: todo list tag if agent output todo list.
    NO_COMPLETED_TAG: todo item is not completed tag.
    COMPLETED_TAG: todo item is completed tag.
    ORDER_START_TAG: todo item order start tag

    subplan: subplan
    todo_list: current todo list
    observations: current observations. It's all observations not just one probably.
"""

think_prompt = """Based on `<subplan>`, `<todo_list>` and `<observations>` select one choice following.
1. make a todo list in following situations.
    1.1 if `<todo_list>` is empty
    1.2 the `<subplan>` is complex.
    1.3 `<subplan>` is about calculation and refered numbers are very big.
    The output format should be started with `{TODO_LIST_TAG}`: .
    For example:
    ```
    {TODO_LIST_TAG}:
    {NO_COMPLETED_TAG}... {ORDER_START_TAG}1{ORDER_END_TAG}
    {NO_COMPLETED_TAG}... {ORDER_START_TAG}2{ORDER_END_TAG}
    {NO_COMPLETED_TAG}... {ORDER_START_TAG}3{ORDER_END_TAG}
    ```
    The number included in {ORDER_START_TAG}{ORDER_END_TAG} is the todo items executing order. If one todo item can be executed paralleling with another todo item their order should be the same.
    For example:
        I have five todo items in my todo list. The first and the third can be executed parallely and the second and fourth should be executed following the first and the third. Finally all todo items are all executed the fifth todo item is executed.
        Based on aboving saying the first and the third item order is 1. The second and the fourth order is 2. Finally the fifth todo item order is 3.

2. select first not completed todo item in `<todo_list>` and try to analyze it and solve it with available tools.
    2.1 You can use many tools to analyze and solve the problem.
    2.2 You can decompose a big task into a series of small tasks.
    `{NO_COMPLETED_TAG}` means the todo item is not completed and `{COMPLETED_TAG}` means the todo item is completed
3. fix it if the latest observation raise error. The probable reason: 
    3.1 You select a wrong tool
    3.2 You don't give the right arguments.
    3.3 The tool is wrong during developer implementing it.
4. output the reuslt if you think you can solve it directly or you can solve it easily with `<observations>`
   or `<user_question>` is an easy question.
   The output format should be started with `{SOLVED_TAG}`:. 
   For example:
    ```
    {SOLVED_TAG}: I have successfully solve the problem. Now the following content is answer. ...
    ```
5. request user for more information to solve the problem. Sometimes `<user_question>` is obscure because not everyone
   are capable of clearly describing their needs or questions. You should be patient to request more information about it.
   The request format should be started with `{OBSCURE_QUESTION_TAG}`: .
   For example: 
   ```
   {OBSCURE_QUESTION_TAG}: I'm so sorry that I need more information to solve the question. ...
   ```

Notice:
    1. Due to you are a general task solving artificial intelligence and be human-like friend, your facing `<user_question>`
    is not always serious tech/study/work problem and other similiar topics. If `<subplan>` is a relax topic or just
    for chat. You can be more humour and more considerate. 
    2. The output of todo_list should be a list which satisfied a markdown format.
